So, we've ordered the parts and they are on their way all the way from United States, New York. Meanwhile the parts are on their way, we went in to the FabLab and really focused our minds towards the fact that we've got to be able to present this thing we are building. The best way to present and demonstrate blinds tilt-mechanism automating magic wand, we *must* build a fake window frame. Let's get into it. 🤖

In order to do this, certain things must happen in a certain order. To document the flow of actions that were carried out in order to digitally fabricate a presentation window frame, we ended up with the following list of do's:

1. Find some blinds, that are preferably small and portable for representative purposes.
2. Detach the found blinds using necessary tools, such as screwdriver.
3. Pack up and carry the blinds to the FabLab.
4. Meet up with your team members to think of possible solutions in collaborative manner
5. Expose the blinds in front of measurement devices and document some critical measurements such as width, length and height.
6. Consult people around you and brainstorm for ideas how to display the blinds with the measurements and the actual blinds with you.
7. Come up with an idea to build an actual frame, that is just a box without one side.
8. Generate a dovetail joints based box design with the aid of [boxes.py] script collection, that is able to generate such a box with given parameters.
9. Tune and optimize boxes.py generated printable vector graphics in order to save in material costs (and save the nature 🌱).
10. Stop wasting too much time and just laser cut the damn thing, five iterations of optimizing is enough!
11. Receive the laser cut board of mdf and remove the parts from the board.
12. Leave the over-left scrap board for others to be used and collect the actual box parts.
13. Assemble the parts with the aid of soft hammering the pieces together.
14. Receive the assembled frame and confirm it holds some weight by swinging it around a bit
15. Attach the blinds using nothing but the small "stack pieces"
16. Pat your teammates and yourself to the back and take some pride in the work you've done, you made the blinds great again 👏🏻🥂
